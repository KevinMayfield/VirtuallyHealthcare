Both of these skin conditions can cause similar symptoms on the ear, and both conditions we can treat with topical steroid cream. I've recommended a topical steroid for you to use once daily for up to 7 days. This condition can be recurrent, so if it resolves but then reappears several weeks to months later, you can reapply the same topical steroid cream. Please follow-up if your skin condition does not improve despite the use of the cream."
