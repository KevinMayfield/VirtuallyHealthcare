## Mappings and Model

This is based on converting IHE Europe [Document Metadata](https://www.ihe-europe.net/sites/default/files/2017-11/IHE_ITI_XDS_Metadata_Guidelines_v1.0.pdf) (which contains references to NHS England terminology), to HL7 FHIR following [DocumentReference - XDS metadata equivalent](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documentreference-mappings.html#xds)

For HL7 v2 MDM T02, see [HL7 v2 MDM T02 Mapping](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/v2-to-fhir/ConceptMap-message-mdm-t02-to-bundle.html)
