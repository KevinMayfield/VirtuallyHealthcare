Insert a diagram showing how we use HL7 IPA or QEDm to get patient records in front of a clinician or patient.

Note in the diagram below, GET /DocumentReference is [Find Documents](find-documents.html). Some suppliers will only be able to share clinical records as documents, they will not be able to share the structured or detailed records. 
We should aim for this structured clinical records, this provides a better service to clinicians as reading documents can be time-consuming. As can be seen in the diargam the API brings out (or extracts) key information from the patient record.
